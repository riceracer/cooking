# Chicken Picaccata Pasta

## Ingredients

* 12 ounces (1/2 to 3/4 box) bow tie (farfalle) pasta
* 1.5 lbs pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided (2 and 4 tbps)
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 shallot, chopped
* 4 garlic cloves, pressed
* 1.5 cups chicken stock
* 1/4 cup lemon juice (from ~2 lemons)
* 2 tablespoons drained capers
* Roughly chopped parsley (about 1/8 or 1/4 bunch)

## Steps

1. Boil bow-tie pasta in salted water. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water then drain and set aside pasta.
2. Cut the chicken into 1/2-inch chunks, and place in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Toss with the flour to coat, adding more flour if needed.
3. Prep ingredients: chop shallots, press garlic cloves, squeeze 1/4 cup lemon juice, drain 2 tbps capers.
4. In a 12-inch all-clad skillet: heat 2 tablespoons butter and the olive oil over med-high/high heat until bubbling.
5. Add the chicken in batches to prevent crowding. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through with some golden spots and edges. Transfer cooked pieces to a plate as they finish, adding butter if necessary for second batches. 
    * *Allow pan to brown for the sauce, but prevent burning/black spots.*
6. Reduce heat to medium-high / medium, and add the shallot and garlic, and cook until softened and fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. 
    * *Add a small amount of extra butter before this step if pan is dry.*
8. Add the stock, and simmer until reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes.
9. Adjust the heat to low, and stir in the remaining 4 tablespoons butter, the lemon juice and the capers.
10. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.
11. Return the chicken to the skillet. 
12. Add the pasta and toss to coat. If more sauce is desired, stir in small splashes of the reserved pasta water. Remove from heat.
13. Serve topped with parsley and black pepper to taste.

## Notes

* Measured prep and cooking time: 55 minutes
* Watch the heat carefully in the 2nd batch of chicken and when starting to cook garlic and shallots, consider adding more butter at those steps to prevent burning. The pan should have brown spots but black spots will cause sauce to be bitter.
