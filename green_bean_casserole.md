# Green Bean Casserole

## Ingedients

* 2 boxes French's Crispy Fried Onions (6 oz each)

* 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
* 1 pound fresh green beans, rinsed, trimmed and halved
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 12 ounces mushrooms, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1 cup chicken broth
* 1 cup half-and-half

## Steps

Beans:

1. Bring a gallon of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to a boil in an 8-quart saucepan. Add the beans and blanch for 5 minutes.
2. Drain and immediately plunge the beans into a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and set aside.

Mushrooms:

3. Melt the butter in a 12-inch cast iron skillet set over medium-high heat.
4. Add the mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper and cook, until the mushrooms begin to give up some of their liquid, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. 
5. Add the garlic and nutmeg and continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. 
6. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute. 
7. Add the broth and simmer for 1 minute. 
8. Decrease the heat to medium-low and add the half-and-half. Cook until the mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, approximately 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat

Combine:

9. In a 8x8 pan (or 9x13 if doubling), stir in 1/4 of the onions and all of the green beans. Top with the remaining onions. 
10. Bake at 400° F until bubbly, approximately 15 minutes.

## Alterations

* Double recipe for 8-10 people/Thanksgiving dinners and bake in a 9x13 pan

## Substitutions

Original recipe has making your own fried onions. I find the store fried onions crispier/better than what I can do. If making the fried onions by hand:

* 2 medium onions, thinly sliced
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons panko bread crumbs
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt

Steps:

1. Combine the onions, flour, panko and salt in a large mixing bowl and toss to combine.
2. Spread the onions on a nonstick cooking pan.
3. Bake at 475° F until golden brown, approximately 30 minutes. 
4. Toss the onions 2 to 3 times during cooking. 
5. Set aside until ready to use.
