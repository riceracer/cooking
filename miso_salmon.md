# Miso Salmon

## Ingredients

* Salmon or Stealhead fillets

Sauce
* 2 Tbsp Miso (white miso paste)
* 1 Tbsp Sake (e.g. Sho Chiku Bai)
* 1 Tbsp Mirin (e.g. Yaegaki Mirin / sweet sake for cooking)
* 1 Tbsp Soy Sauce (low sodium)
* 1/4 tsp toasted seasame oil

Garnish
* 1/2 tsp toasted white and/or black seasame seeds
* 1 green onion/scallion, chopped

## Steps

Prepare 1-2 hours before cooking for marinating time.

1. *Debone salmon* and scrape off scales from skin with a knife.
2. *Prepare marinade:* mix the miso, sake, mirin, soy sauce and seasame oil in a bowl.
3. *Cut salmon* into individual size fillets for even cooking.
4. *Spoon marinade* onto salmon, then turn over and leave salmon (skin up) to soak in marinade 1-2 hours.
5. *Broil*: turn on broiler to 500-550 F, and set oven rack to 9 inches from the heaters.
Cover a cooking sheet in aluminum foil, remove excess marinade from salmon and place skin-down on the cooking sheet. Cook for 10-13 minutes, keeping an eye on it to avoid burning.
6. Remove when internal temp is at least 120-145 F.
7. *Serve*: Top with sesame seeds and thinly sliced green onions if desired. If you wish you can cook the marinade on the stovetop and serve as sauce.

If baking instead of broiling, cook at 425 F for about 20 minutes.
